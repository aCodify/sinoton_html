				</p>
				<p>
					In the alcohol industry , the fuel ethanol ( alcohol ) dry cassava chip manufacturer is the greatest demand by 80 percent
					of dry cassava is used in the production of fuel ethanol. Fuel ethanol ( alcohol ) is a manufacturer of dry cassava as raw
					material to produce fuel alcohol. Fuel ethanol fuel oxygenates are used to form an additive ethanol gasoline. Ethanol
					gasoline is the fuel ethanol ( alcohol ) by a certain percentage of mixed motor fuel formation. Ethanol gasoline has
					replaced the regular gasoline.
				</p>
				<p>
					China is now dried cassava slices of raw materials for the production of ethanol ( alcohol ) required about 600 million
					tons. Production of fuel ethanol, gasoline accounted for alternatives , industrial alcohol, consumption of alcohol,
					consumption of alcohol may blending liquor ; industrial alcohol used for medicine , disinfectants.
				</p>
				<p>
					In China , the production of alcohol to rely mainly maize, cassava and molasses and other raw materials. However , in
